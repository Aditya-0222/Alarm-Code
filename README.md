**# Driver-Alarm-Code**
 - `import` statements: At the beginning of the script, we have several import statements that bring external modules into our program for use: - `import time`: imports the time module, which provides various time-related functions.
 In this case, we'll see `time.sleep` being used.
 - `import keyboard`: brings in the keyboard module to detect key presses on your keyboard.
 - `import winsound`: allows access to Windows API calls related to sound (beeps).
 It is specific to Windows OS.
 - The function `check_head_position()` doesn't take any arguments and contains the actual logic for monitoring head movements.
 - The while loop, denoted by `while True:`, means "loop indefinitely" or "keep running this block of code until manually stopped," because the condition `True` never ceases to be valid unless some breaking operation occurs inside the loop (which isn't here).
 - Inside the while loop: - We see a conditional statement checking if either 'left' or 'right' arrow keys are pressed using conditions: ``` if keyboard.is_pressed('left') or keyboard.is_pressed('right'): ``` This is done using the imported `keyboard` module's method `.is_pressed()`, which returns True when the specified key(s) are pressed.
 - If either left or right arrow keys are pressed, it will print: `"Driver is awake!"`.
 So whenever a simulated 'head movement' happens with arrow keys, this print line acts as an acknowledgment of that motion indicating alertness.

 The code attempts to simulate head movements using the left and right arrow keys and check if the driver is awake.
 If the driver is not pressing any of the arrow keys, a beep sound will be played to alert them.
 This code can be used as an anti-sleep alarm system to prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving.
